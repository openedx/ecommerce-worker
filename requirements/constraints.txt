# Version constraints for pip-installation.
#
# This file doesn't install any packages. It specifies version constraints
# that will be applied if a package is needed.
#
# When pinning something here, please provide an explanation of why.  Ideally,
# link to other information that will help people in the future to remove the
# pin when possible.  Writing an issue against the offending project and
# linking to it here is good.

# These were previously pinned in ecommerce-worker, and will stay that way
# until we go through the process of relaxing them gradually.

# breaking changes in CLI and dropped support for python3.5 in celery 5.0
celery<5.0


# some other package are bringing django3.0 so adding constraint.
Django<2.3
